# Progress Tracker

Update this file after every meaningful implementation
change.

## Current Phase

- Complete (design system)

## Current Goal

- None. Design system unit is done.

## Completed

- `01-design-system` — shadcn/ui (Button, Card, Dialog, Input, Tabs, Textarea, ScrollArea), `cn()` in `lib/utils.ts`, lucide-react, dark theme tokens in `app/globals.css`

## In Progress

- None yet.

## Next Up

- Next feature unit from `context/feature-specs/`

## Open Questions

- None.

## Architecture Decisions

- shadcn/ui is the component foundation; generated files in `components/ui/` are not modified after install. Theme mapping lives in `globals.css`.
- Dark-only theme: tokens from `ui-context.md` are applied on `:root` and `.dark`. The document root always has the `dark` class. shadcn semantic tokens (`background`, `primary`, `card`, …) map onto those product tokens.

## Session Notes

- Implemented `context/feature-specs/01-design-system.md`. Do not edit `components/ui/*`.
